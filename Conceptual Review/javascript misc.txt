Abstract vs Strict Equality:

Abstract equality will attempt to resolve the data types via type coercion before making a comparison. Strict equality will return false if the types are different. 
    == equal value
    === equal value and equal type


What are the advantages of using JavaScript?
    - Lightweight: JavaScript can be executed within the user’s browser without having to communicate with the server, saving on bandwidth.
    - Versatile: JS can be used on both front-end and server-side technologies.
    - Rich interface: JS has some of the most popular fronend frameworks like React and AngularJS


What's the weakness of using JavaScript?

JavaScript’s main weakness is security. Look for answers on how it can be exploited. A secondary weakness is JavaScript’s ubiquity and versatility—it can be a double-edged sword in that there’s a lot of room for programming quirks that can lead to inconsistent performance across different platforms.


What's the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance?

    Classical inheritance: A new instance instantiated via the "new" keyword. The new instance inherits properties from a parent class.

    Prototypal inheritance: An instance created by cloning an existing object that serves as a prototype. The instance can benefit from many inheritance from many different objects. 

    In JavaScript, objects have a special hidden property [Prototype]. When we want to read a property from object, and it’s missing, JavaScript automatically takes it from the prototype. In programming, such thing is called “prototypal inheritance”. 

        let animal = {
            eats: true
        };
        let rabbit = {
            jumps: true
        };

        rabbit.__proto__ = animal;
