JS & "Client-side Processing":

Javascript was traditionally the language of the web browser, performing computations directly on a user’s machine. This is referred to as “client-side” processing. With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript has become a compelling “server-side” language as well, which was traditionally the domain of languages like Java, Python and PHP.


What is an isomorphic application?

In web development, an isomorphic application is one whose code (in this case, JavaScript) can run both in the server and the client.
